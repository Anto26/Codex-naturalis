 * (calling match.someMethod(...)) when a certain transition has occurred.
 * Each method is supposed to be overridden by a subclass of MatchState if and only if it is allowed to be called from
 * that specific subclass; if not overridden, the MatchState version of the method will be called and thus an exception
